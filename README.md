Connect to database by modifying MySQL credentials from `/application/config/database.php`.


***Connect to localhost database only*** as, otherwise, your remote/live database credentials might get revealed on this git repository source code since this repository is publicly visible by anyone.


Go to `/application/models/attendee_model.php` and you will find some ToDo's there.
These ToDo's are all we will need to complete after we have real data.


Ensure that the MySQL database table column names match with the key-names mentioned in the `get_attendee_info()` function.


To run the script and to generate all attendee cards, go to `/badge/generate_all` from your browser
